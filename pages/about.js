        The first human case of monkeypox was recorded in 1970 in the Democratic
        Republic of Congo. Since then, monkeypox has been reported in humans in
        other central and western African countries. In 2022, an unusual amount
        of monkeypox cases around the world have prompted concern and interest
        from health officials and the public.
